* RS-BASEN

The RS-BASEN library is a generic base /n/ encoding/decoding library
for /n/ âˆˆ {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}.  Focus is on convenience, not speed.
Basis is RFC 4648 but you can configure the encoder/decoder to suite
your needs.


** Notable Features

- Input and output can be streams, strings, sequences, or pathnames.
- Implicit UTF-8 character encoding/decoding for strings.
- The alphabet and padding is configurable.
- The line length and newline character sequence for chunked output
  is configurable.
- The treatment of whitespace characters in the input is configurable.
- Convenience functions for
  - RFC 4648 base 64, base 32, and base 16 encodings,
  - RFC 2045 MIME base 64 content transfer encoding, and
  - RFC 1421 PEM printable encoding.
